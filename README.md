# MoneyManager

This is a MERN stack single-page web application to help users keep track of their expenses. The application includes authentication, authorization, 
dashboard, adding expenses and deleting expenses. A dedicated API was built using Express.js.

## Technology Stack

The project is developed using the Node.js runtime environment which allows us to write JavaScript code on the server-side. 
Express.js was used to develop the MoneyManager application programming interface (API). 
MongoDB is the selected document type database for the project and MongoDB Atlas is used as the database management system of the web application. 
Back-end libraries have been used such as Bcrypt.js for password encryption and hashing, Express-validator for validation and sensitisation of functions,
JWN for authentication and authorization and Mongoose for MongoDB object modelling. For the Front-End HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript have been used for interface, styling and functionality. Additionally, React.js has been used for achieving a single-page web application.
The Front-End libraries used are Redux for state management, Axios for sending HTTP requests and UUID for generating random IDs. 
The table below displays all technologies used in the development of the project.
